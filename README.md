# 21.0.0-Homebrew-Compatability
A large project that will track and hopefully update every single switch homebrew app and its compatibility with atmosphere 1.10.0+. Visit the [issues](https://github.com/auggeythecat/21.0.0-Homebrew-Compatability/issues) and [project board](https://github.com/users/auggeythecat/projects/3).
This can also be used as a master list. Feel free to open an issue with a new app. (note: piracy related or closed source apps (tinfoil, dbi, etc) will removed)

# Contributing
1. Pick and app. Preferably one with the https://github.com/auggeythecat/21.0.0-Homebrew-Compatability/labels/Requested label.
2. Comment `/claim` to assign yourself to the issue.
3. Work on it. Start a discussion on the issue, Add things to the projects folder or NOTES.md file
4. There is currently not a good solution for finishing one. I guess just say its done and link an open source repo in the issue.
