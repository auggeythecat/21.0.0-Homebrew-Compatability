# 21.0.0-Homebrew-Compatability
A large project that will track and hopefully update every single switch homebrew app and its compatibility with atmosphere 1.10.0+. Visit the [issues](https://github.com/auggeythecat/21.0.0-Homebrew-Compatability/issues) and [project board](https://github.com/users/auggeythecat/projects/3).
This can also be used as a master list. Feel free to open an issue with a new app. (note: piracy related or closed source apps (tinfoil, dbi, etc) will removed) 

Also note that currently some apps are incorrect on this tracker. If you find one that is wrong, please notify me.
# Contributing
1. Pick an app. Preferably one with the https://github.com/auggeythecat/21.0.0-Homebrew-Compatability/labels/Requested label.
2. Comment `/claim` to assign yourself to the issue.
3. Work on it. Start a discussion on the issue, Add things to the projects folder or NOTES.md file
4. There is currently not a good solution for finishing one. I guess just say its done and link it and the code in the issue. (diff or patch files do work)

I would prefer if it was built with docker so its accessable, but its not required.
